## Rules

Tasks for you to complete are tagged with @todo.

For @todo 1, 2 and 3, see StateComponent.js
For @todo 4, see HooksComponent.js

You are allowed to modify any file EXCEPT for index.js.

You may be asked to explain your answers and thought process after you submit your answers.

### Resources

You are allowed (and encouraged!) to use most resources available to you online. If you do use any resource such as StackOverflow, Github, etc. Please paste a link to the thread/page you used in a // comment in the file you used the answer.

- Do not use the help of friends, mentors, colleagues, etc.
- Do not install any additional library/module

### Time

You should strive to complete this project in under 90 minutes (not counting the time you spend reading this document).
If you require more time, that is acceptable, but you are then required to report how much time you spent on this.

### Help

If you have any questions regarding a task make an assumption, and note said assumption with a // comment where that assumption was made.

If you are stuck on a problem, you may skip it and move on to the next one.
If you are running out of time and have not finished a task, make sure your code is compiling first, and then use // comments to explain what your approach would be.

### Submission

To begin, create a Code Sandbox account, fork this repo and code away!
Please develop entirely on Code Sandbox for simplicity.

To submit, save all your files. Then, email us with the sandbox link. Please do NOT make any more changes once the email is sent.
